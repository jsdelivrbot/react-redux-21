## Notes
- Search Bar for youtube API
  - covers exporting modules, classes and state.
- Functional Component vs. ES6 Class: Stephen recommends beginning with a 
functional component and only when you decide you need added functionality should
you refactor to class (fine to use a class even if you don't need it).
- Handling events in React - Two Steps
  - First: declare an event handler - function that should be ran whenever the event occurs
  - Second: we pass the event handler to the element we want to monitor for events e.g. input
